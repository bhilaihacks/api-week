# API 102 with Postman

Dear API builder üõ†Ô∏è,\
I hope you're doing amazing!

**GOOD NEWS:** We're 200+ strong! ü•≥

We would like to extend our sincerest gratitude to all the API builders who joined us for API 102 during API Week. Your enthusiasm, curiosity, and dedication to learning and improving your skills never cease to amaze us. We hope that you found the session to be informative, practical, and enjoyable, and that you were able to gain valuable insights and knowledge on building workflows with APIs. üôè

We had an exhilarating session for API 102 during API Week! üëã

Our first speaker, Mitul, delivered an energetic presentation that covered building workflows with APIs. The slides were beautifully designed and the speaker's explanations were both informative and well-defined.

During the presentation, Mitul covered key components of building workflows with APIs, including API requests and responses, data formats, and authentication. Real-world examples were used to provide clear and concise explanations of these components, making them easy to understand and apply in practice. With the knowledge gained from the presentation, API builders can confidently incorporate these components into their own workflows to create more sophisticated and powerful applications.

The second speaker demonstrated the practical application of building workflows with APIs. The speaker completed the demonstration in under an hour despite the inherent difficulties of presenting a workshop on a YouTube live stream without interactive participation. The session highlighted the challenges that API builders may face when working with APIs, as well as the rewards of persistence and problem-solving.&#x20;

In particular, the speaker encountered an issue with the API request but was able to debug the problem and fix the URL, ultimately receiving a 200 OK response. The speaker also shared a recommendation workflow of the API that enables users to access two artists and receive three recommendations.

Additionally, as the host, I would like to acknowledge that we made an error in publishing the incorrect challenge for Challenge II. As committed, we have since corrected the challenge to reflect the same one that we explained during the workshop. We apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused and hope that our API builders will continue to participate and enjoy the challenges.

We understand that workshops like this can be challenging, but we're thrilled to offer this session for easy access anytime. We encourage our API builders to review the presentation, reference the workflows demonstrated, and continue learning and improving their skills. Additionally, we're confident that the presentation and demonstration will be valuable resources for API builders who are looking to enhance their knowledge and expertise.
