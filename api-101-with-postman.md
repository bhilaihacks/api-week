# API 101 with Postman

Dear API enthusiasts, \
I hope you're doing awesome! <3\
\
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all the API enthusiasts who attended API 101 in API Week. Your passion and enthusiasm for APIs were truly inspiring, and your willingness to learn and engage in discussions made the event a huge success. ðŸš€

The API 101 session experienced a challenging start as the first speaker faced technical issues due to a poor internet connection. Despite her best efforts, the speaker was unable to deliver her presentation seamlessly, as the network connection was unstable due to her travel. As a result, attendees found it challenging to follow along with the presentation, leading to confusion and disorientation. ðŸ˜•

Nevertheless, the organizers took swift action, and  I took over the session and worked hard to compensate for the connectivity issues. I started by providing a brief overview of what APIs are and how they work, ensuring that everyone was on the same page. ðŸ˜„

In my API session, I used a toy as an analogy to explain APIs. Like the Lego bricks of software development, APIs allow different software components to communicate and work together seamlessly, much like how the various parts of a toy work together to create a cohesive whole. By understanding this analogy and the basics of APIs, developers can build powerful and adaptable applications. ðŸ§¸

Then, the practical exercises began, and the new speaker, Pooja Gera was able to guide everyone through the exercises despite the internet connectivity issues. They provided clear explanations and easy-to-follow instructions, making it easy for attendees to create their own working APIs. ðŸ’–

Pooja was a standout speaker in the API session, delivering the practical part with skill and aplomb. Attendees were impressed with her ability to simplify complex concepts and explain them in a way that was easy to understand. Moreover, Pooja's interaction with the audience was excellent, she was attentive to their needs, and answered all questions with clarity and enthusiasm. Her positive attitude and engaging presentation style made the session enjoyable and memorable for all participants. Organizers were also impressed with her professionalism and expertise, and it was clear that Pooja was a valuable asset to the session. Overall, Pooja's contribution to the API session was a resounding success, and everyone appreciated her knowledge, talent, and approachable demeanor. ðŸ¥¹ <3

In the final segment of the API session, we assigned a challenge to the attendees, outlining the necessary details such as expected deliverables, submission procedures, evaluation criteria, and exciting giveaways for the top performers. Before concluding, we also facilitated a Q\&A session to address any concerns or questions that the participants had. We had promised to provide a comprehensive and informative session at the outset, and we ensured to keep that commitment by delivering an engaging and insightful presentation. The challenge was aimed at helping the attendees to apply the concepts learned during the session practically. By incorporating a Q\&A session, I provided an opportunity for the participants to clarify any doubts and ensured that they left with a clear understanding of the material covered. âœ…
