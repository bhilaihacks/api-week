Pradumna Saraf, a well-known face in the Open Source community and Postman Student Leader, provided an informative and engaging session. He deep-dived into the flow of sending requests and responses, and how to visualize them based on success or failure conditions. And let me tell you, the visualization capabilities of Postman with images are mind-blowing!

From crypto market up-downs to real-world use cases, Pradumna gave us insights how to make the most of the Postman flow visualizer like, gauge, boolean, chart, image & more. And for all you beginners to intermediate-level participants, this session was a fun and informative learning experience.

While the session was not a deadline for the Challenge II - Build Workflows with APIs, we consider it as an extended session or for **SIG (Special Interest Group).**

We also want to give a shout-out to Ayush, the host of the extended session and Postman Student Leader from Shri Shankaracharya Technical Campus. He played his part well and even shared a post on LinkedIn by found it really overwhelmed. Let's show him some love and appreciation!
