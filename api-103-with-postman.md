# API 103 with Postman

Dear API Evangelist ü´°,\
Hope you're in the building.

We kicked off API 103 with an exciting session where I had the pleasure of hosting and speaking to our enthusiastic audience. The presentation included a series of slides that covered theoretical aspects of the client-side and server-side folders, which are combined as a monorepo in practice. I was thrilled to interact with the audience members who joined us on the YouTube live stream, and their engagement helped make the session even more dynamic.

Basant Barupal, an exceptional live programmer, took on the challenge of building a web application using the workflow that we introduced in API 102. Despite the challenges of live programming, Basant's dedication paid off and we were able to develop an impressive Spotify song recommender app using Tailwind CSS. The application was deployed on the `railway.app`, which added to the excitement of the event.

We also used TailwindCSS to beautify our application:

In the final stages of our project, we encountered a roadblock when attempting to deploy our Express app on `Vercel`. After realizing that this platform would not meet our deployment needs, we quickly made the decision to switch to `railway.app`  our hosting solution. As committed, we are happy to share the link to our completed project with you below.

It was truly gratifying to see the joy on the faces of our participants as they built a web application that met all the required specifications. Although it was challenging to stay engaged throughout the session, the effort was well worth it.

Congratulations to all the participants who learned and built something meaningful. Now, it's time to share your creations with the world. This is where Challenge III comes in - I explained the details in the video and provided an image below for reference.

Thank you for sticking with us until the end of the session. Pat yourself on the back, you're now an API-ready developer!
